# Constrained Nonlinear Control through Driftless Approximations

This respository contains a simple code accompanying the paper ["Ignore Drift, Embrace Simplicity: Constrained Nonlinear Control through Driftless Approximations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06188). The code is particular to the second example of the paper, for the forced Van der Pol oscillator, but can be easily modified to suit a user's needs. 

Run main_code.m to exactly replicate Example 2 in the paper. Functions f and g can be modified to be used for any other system, though other parameters (including T and t^*) will have to be suitably modified for accurate performance and satisfying constraints.
