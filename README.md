# ConstNLControl

This respository contains a simple code accompanying the paper "Ignore Drift, Embrace Simplicity: Constrained Nonlinear Control through Driftless Approximations". The code is particular to the second example of the paper, for the forced Van der Pol oscillator, but can be easily modified to suit a user's needs. 

Run main_code.m to exactly replicate Example 2 in the paper. Functions f and g can be modified to be used for any other system, though other parameters (including T and t^*) will have to be suitably modified for accurate performance and satisfying constraints.
